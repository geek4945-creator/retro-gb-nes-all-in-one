# Retro Pocket — 46 retro systems in one app (Game Boy → PlayStation, N64, PSP, Sega, Atari, arcade, DOS…)

An all-in-one retro emulator that runs **in the browser** (installable on iPhone from Safari as a Home Screen app) and as an **Android APK**. It does *not* need RetroArch installed: it embeds [EmulatorJS](https://github.com/EmulatorJS/EmulatorJS), which ships the RetroArch/libretro cores compiled to WebAssembly.

## ⚖️ Legal

* **Bring your own ROMs.** No games are included or downloaded. Only use dumps of cartridges you own, or homebrew you have the right to play. The ROMs you add never leave your device (they're stored in the browser's local database).
* **No commercial BIOS, ever.** Original BIOS/firmware files (Sony, Sega, Nintendo, Atari, SNK, NEC, Panasonic/3DO, Coleco, Commodore…) are copyrighted: they are **not** in this repository, **not** downloaded by the app, and the app never links to dump sites or archive copies. You supply them from your own console. The only BIOS-type files that can be downloaded are the **three open-licensed replacements** listed under [BIOS files](#-bios-files) (MIT / Expat), mirrored in `www/bios-open/` together with their licence texts; `npm run check` fails if anything else is placed there or a checksum / licence entry is missing.
* **Licensing:** this project is released under **GPL-3.0** (see `LICENSE`). It loads [EmulatorJS](https://github.com/EmulatorJS/EmulatorJS) (GPL-3.0) and the RetroArch/libretro cores (Gambatte GPL-2.0, mGBA MPL-2.0, FCEUmm/Nestopia GPL-2.0, DeSmuME GPL-2.0, melonDS GPL-3.0, Mupen64Plus-Next GPL-2.0, PCSX ReARMed GPL-2.0, PPSSPP GPL-2.0, Genesis Plus GX / SMS Plus **non-commercial** licences, Snes9x **non-commercial**, Stella GPL-2.0, MAME 2003 / FBNeo **non-commercial**, VICE GPL-2.0, DOSBox Pure GPL-2.0 …) from the EmulatorJS CDN at runtime. Several cores forbid commercial use, so do not sell this app or publish it commercially; check each core's licence if you redistribute. Apple's App Store is generally incompatible with GPL — which is why the iPhone version is a Home Screen web app.

## 📱 iPhone / iPad (runs in Safari, saved to Home Screen)

1. On your iPhone open **`https://<your-github-username>.github.io/retro-gb-nes-all-in-one/`** in **Safari** (it must be Safari — not Chrome — for *Add to Home Screen* to create a full-screen app).
2. Tap the **Share** button (square with the up-arrow at the bottom).
3. Scroll down and tap **Add to Home Screen**.
4. Tap **Add** (top-right). A *Retro Pocket* icon appears on your Home Screen.
5. Open it from the Home Screen, tap **＋ Add games**, and pick ROM files from the Files app / iCloud Drive / Downloads. Tap a game to play; tap the on-screen **Start** button once (iOS needs a tap to unlock sound).
6. Tap **‹ Library** to leave a game — it auto-saves and shows **▶ Resume** next time.

The first launch of each system downloads its core (~1–4 MB) from the EmulatorJS CDN; after that it is cached and works offline. Tip: if Safari ever clears website data for the app, the ROM library goes with it — keep your original ROM files.

## 🤖 Android

**Option A – APK:** download `RetroPocket-debug.apk` from the repo's **Releases** page (rolling `latest` release), or from the newest run in the **Actions → Build Android APK** tab (artifact `RetroPocket-debug-apk`). Open it and allow *Install unknown apps* when asked.

### 📲 Installing and updating the APK (read this once)

Android only installs an update **over** an existing app when the new APK is signed with the **same key** and has a **higher versionCode**. Earlier builds were signed with a throw-away debug key that CI generated fresh on every run, so updating over them failed with *"App not installed" / "package conflicts"*. That is fixed for all builds from now on:

* **One stable signing key** for every build: a private keystore stored as GitHub Actions secrets (`RP_KEYSTORE_B64`, `RP_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD`, `RP_KEY_ALIAS`, `RP_KEY_PASSWORD`; never in the repo). If the secrets are missing (forks, PRs) the build falls back to a committed, *public* debug keystore (`android/app/retropocket-fallback.keystore`) — consistent, but **not secret and not the same key**, so only use release-key builds for your own device.
* **Increasing version:** `versionCode = 1000 + number of commits`, `versionName = 1.0.<commits>-<sha>`; `applicationId` stays `com.retropocket.app`. The workflow runs `apksigner verify` and checks the versionCode of the built APK; the signing-certificate SHA-256 and version are printed in the job summary and the release notes.

**Exact steps**
1. **One time only (because of the old key):** uninstall the old *Retro Pocket* app (Settings → Apps → Retro Pocket → Uninstall). ⚠️ This deletes the library, save states and BIOS files, which live in the app's WebView storage — the old builds have no export function, so they cannot be saved; keep your original ROM files. (Alternatively keep using the web app/PWA, whose data is separate.)
2. Install the newest `RetroPocket-debug.apk` from the Releases page.
3. **From now on** just download and open the next APK: it installs **over** the current one and keeps your data. You can also check inside the app: **Settings → 🔄 Check for updates** (shows a *Download APK* banner when a newer build exists).
4. Before any future uninstall/reinstall (or moving to another phone): **Settings → 💾 Backup & restore → Export backup** (games, states, cover art, BIOS, settings in one ZIP) and import it afterwards. (Some Android app WebViews cannot save downloaded files; if the export does not produce a file, use the web app in Chrome for the backup.)

Verified on two consecutive CI builds (1.0.15 → versionCode 1015, then the next one): identical signer certificate, higher versionCode.

Signing certificate of the stable key (SHA-256): `3D:22:72:23:FC:4D:C7:E5:6E:18:7B:CE:E3:DD:28:11:66:8E:AE:21:0A:9E:E4:C2:AE:EB:17:03:50:F7:12:7C` — `apksigner verify --print-certs RetroPocket-debug.apk` should print exactly this (lower-case, no colons).

### 🔄 Web app updates

The service worker is **network-first** (online you always get the newest files; the cache is only the offline fallback) and a new version installs in the background and **waits**: you get *Update available — Reload* (and **Settings → Check for updates**) instead of half-old/half-new files. Every deployment is stamped with the commit count (`www/build-info.json`, `www/js/version.js`, service-worker `VERSION`). Tested by `node tests/update.mjs`.

**Option B – PWA (no APK):** open the Pages URL above in **Chrome** → ⋮ menu → **Install app** / **Add to Home screen**.

## 🖼 Cover art

* When you add a ROM, Retro Pocket cleans the file name (`Super Mario Bros. (World) [!].nes` → *Super Mario Bros.*), looks it up in the [libretro thumbnails](https://github.com/libretro-thumbnails) listing for that system (one libretro-thumbnails repository per system, e.g. `Sony - PlayStation`, `Nintendo - Nintendo 64`, `Sega - Mega Drive - Genesis`, `FBNeo - Arcade Games`, `DOS` — see `art` in `www/js/cores.js`; every repository name was checked against GitHub), fuzzy-matches region/revision tags (e.g. *Tetris (World)* → `Tetris (World) (Rev 1).png`), tries **Named_Boxarts** then **Named_Titles**, and falls back to a generated cover (system colour + title).
* Art is downscaled and cached in IndexedDB, so it shows offline. **Refresh cover art** (per game ⋯ menu) and **🖼 Get art (n)** (library) fetch missing covers again.
* **CORS note:** `thumbnails.libretro.com` sends no `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header, so browsers can't `fetch` it or read it into a canvas. The same files live in GitHub repos whose `raw.githubusercontent.com` / `api.github.com` endpoints are CORS-enabled, so art is fetched from there. `thumbnails.libretro.com` is only used as a display-only last resort.
* **Change cover…** (per game ⋯ menu): search prefilled with *title + system*; results from **libretro** (box art, title screens, screenshots), **Wikipedia** (page images — usually the real cover), **Wikimedia Commons**, **Internet Archive**, plus optionally **RAWG** if you paste a free API key (stored only on your device). You can also paste an image URL or upload from your camera roll / files, then pan/zoom, crop-to-cover or *Fit*, and save. If an image host blocks CORS, the picker retries through the keyless proxy `images.weserv.nl` (only for the one image you picked) and, failing that, stores a link-only cover. **Reset to automatic** goes back to the libretro match.
* SteamGridDB, IGDB and TheGamesDB require private keys and/or server-side calls, so they are not usable from a static site and are not included.

## 🎮 Nintendo DS notes

* DS emulation is **demanding**. Modern Android phones and recent iPhones can run many games but expect slowdowns; **iPhone Safari may be slow** (WebAssembly without JIT) — DeSmuME 2015 is the lighter core and the default, melonDS is more accurate but heavier (switch via the game's ⋯ menu).
* **No special headers needed for DS.** Both DS cores run in the single-threaded build; only PPSSPP and DOSBox Pure need threads (see *Threads / cross-origin isolation* below).
* DS save states are large, so auto-resume snapshots are taken only when you leave a game, not periodically.

### ✋ DS touchscreen (stylus)

**What was wrong:** EmulatorJS 4.2.3 has no touch API for the DS. RetroArch's web input turns taps into a "pointer", but both DS cores default to *relative-mouse* pointer modes (`desmume_pointer_type = mouse`, `melonds_touch_mode = Mouse`), so a finger on the bottom screen did nothing; even in the cores' absolute mode a finger resting on an on-screen button is first in the touch list, so the stylus finger is lost, and sliding in from the top screen or past the edge was not handled.

**The fix** (`www/js/dstouch.js`, DS games only, both DeSmuME 2015 and melonDS): the player switches the core to its absolute touch mode and puts a transparent overlay over the game canvas (below the on-screen buttons, so buttons keep winning). The overlay computes where the bottom screen is (RetroArch's viewport maths for the current layout, CSS scaling, letter-boxing, orientation and `devicePixelRatio`) and feeds a single, correctly scaled mouse "stylus" to the core via the canvas. It supports tap, hold-and-slide, edge clamping, **multi-touch** (a thumb on A/D-pad while the other finger drives the stylus, in any order), ignores touches that *start* on the top screen, and a real **mouse** works on desktop (without pointer lock).

**Settings** (Library → ⚙ Settings → *Nintendo DS touch & screens…*, and the in-game ☰ menu cycles *Touch* and *Screens* live):
* **Touch mode** — *Direct touch* (default: the stylus is where your finger is) or *Trackpad* (drag moves a cursor without touching; tap = tap at the cursor; tap-then-drag or a second finger = hold the stylus down). Trackpad speed 1×–3×.
* **Screen layout** — *Auto* (stacked in portrait, side-by-side in landscape), *Stacked*, *Stacked swapped*, *Side by side*, *Side by side swapped*, or *Bottom screen only* (bigger stylus area). Applied live through the core's own layout option; touch mapping follows.

**Tests** (`node tests/dstouch.mjs`): a tiny hand-assembled DS "probe" ROM (`scripts/make-ds-touch-rom.py`, not a game) runs on the ARM7 and mirrors the touch panel and key registers into RAM; the test reads them back out of the core. With synthetic CDP touch/mouse input on **both cores** it checks the stylus pixel at centre/corners, drags, top-screen start ignored, edge clamping, A/B-button multi-touch, every layout, portrait/landscape and DPR 1–3, trackpad gestures, desktop mouse, the pause menu, that other systems get no overlay, and it reproduces the original bug. **Not tested:** a real DS game, a real phone or iOS Safari (Pointer Events + synthetic mouse events on iOS are unverified), real-game touch calibration/pressure, or the look of each layout in melonDS (the probe's ARM9 screen output doesn't run there).

## ☰ In-game menu (no pop-up bottom bar)

EmulatorJS' own bottom control bar (it popped up when you touched "dead" areas, hovered near the bottom edge or long-pressed) is **never shown** any more, so touches in empty areas do nothing and never interrupt play (on DS they are ignored too). Instead there is one small, semi-transparent **☰ button at the top of the screen** (44 px tap target, safe-area aware for the iPhone notch / Home Screen app). It opens the pause menu:

* **Resume · Save state · Load state · Restart · Exit to library**
* **Sound** on/off · **Fast-forward** on/off · **Screenshot** (downloads a PNG) · **Fullscreen** (whole page, so the menu stays reachable; hidden where the browser has no fullscreen, e.g. iPhone Safari)
* **Controls…** (EmulatorJS key/touch mapping) · **Cheats…** (where the core supports them) · **Disc / disk…** (multi-disc games) · **Emulator settings…** (EmulatorJS' full settings: shaders, speed ratios, volume, save-state slot, core options — shown in our own full-screen panel)
* **DS only:** *Touch* mode and *Screens* layout · **Menu button position** (cycle)
* Controller: hold **Select + Start** (or **Guide**) still opens the same menu; **Select + R1 / L1** quick save / load are unchanged.

**Settings** (Library → ⚙ Settings → *In-game menu button…*): position **top-left / top-center / top-right**, and **fade out when idle** (on by default: after ~3.5 s the button dims to a faint ghost; it is still there and a single tap still opens the menu, and touching near the top edge brings it back). The library-side *‹ Library* button is gone; use *Exit to library* in the menu.

Tested in `node tests/ingame.mjs` (dead-zone taps, long-press, swipe, desktop hover/click/right-click, ☰ placement/size, every menu function, settings panel, auto-fade, position/auto-hide settings, landscape) and in `tests/dstouch.mjs` (DS dead zones, ☰ does not reach the stylus). Not tested: a real phone / iOS Safari (safe-area insets with a real notch are only checked by CSS `env()`), real fullscreen on iOS, a multi-disc game (the Disc button is verified hidden for single-disc games).

## 📁 ROM folders & "Scan for new ROMs"

The library has a **Scan** button and a **📁 ROM folders** button. Single files can still be added with **＋ Add games**.

| Platform | How it works |
|---|---|
| **Android APK** | Tap **🔄 Scan for new ROMs**. The Android folder picker opens at **Download/**; choose any folder (or several, via ROM folders → Add). Permission is kept, so later scans and the automatic scan at launch read the folder directly (subfolders included). |
| **Chrome / Edge (desktop & Android browser)** | Same flow, using the File System Access API. Folders are remembered. If the browser asks again after a restart, tap **Rescan** to allow access. |
| **iPhone / iPad (Safari, Home Screen app)** | Tap **📥 Scan Downloads**, then **Browse → Downloads → Select (top right) → Select All → Open**. Safari can't open a folder by itself or remember it, so do this each time you've downloaded new games. Only new games are added; the last import time is shown in ROM folders. |
| **Firefox** | "Import a whole folder" (directory upload); same de-duplication. |

- Only **new** files are added. Matching uses the path/size/date index, then name+size and the content hash against the library.
- Pictures, text, saves, and other non-game files are skipped. `.zip`, `.7z`, and every supported ROM extension are imported. `.cue`/`.m3u` files are imported together with the `.bin`/track files they reference.
- Scans never stop to ask questions. A file whose system can't be detected (e.g. a bare `.bin`) is reported as "need a system choice"; add it with **＋**.
- Games are copied into the app's storage, so they keep working offline and when the folder is gone. Removing a folder never deletes games.
- Settings → **📁 ROM folders…** lists the folders with their file count and last scan time, plus Rescan, Remove, and scan progress.

## 🧩 Adding games for many systems

* **Detection:** unique extensions pick the system directly (`.nes`, `.gba`, `.z64`, `.md`, `.sms`, `.a26`, `.pce`, `.ws`, …). For `.bin`/`.iso`/`.cue`/`.chd`/`.zip`/`.7z`/`.img`/`.m3u`/`.pbp`/`.tap`/`.tzx`/`.exe`/`.rom`/`.ccd`, Retro Pocket first **sniffs the content** (iNES / N64 / GBA / Game Boy / Mega Drive / 32X / Master System / Game Gear / Atari 7800 / Lynx headers, `PLAYSTATION` / `SEGADISCSYSTEM` / `SEGASATURN` / PC-FX / 3DO / CD-i disc signatures, and the file names inside a `.zip`). If that is not conclusive you get a **Which system is this?** picker listing the plausible systems first (likely one highlighted) and a *Show all systems…* list. You can change a game's system later in its ⋯ menu.
* **Disc images:** select the `.cue` **together with its `.bin` file(s)** (or an `.m3u` with its discs) and they are bundled into one uncompressed ZIP in the library (which is what EmulatorJS needs; a cue whose tracks are missing is refused with a message). Single `.iso`, `.chd`, `.pbp`, `.img` and `.cso` images work as they are. Very large images (hundreds of MB) need enough free memory and storage; the app is limited to ~1.2 GB per file.
* **Arcade:** add the exact ROM-set `.zip` (FBNeo, or MAME 0.78 / 2003-Plus sets). Neo Geo sets go under **Neo Geo** and need `neogeo.zip` in Settings → BIOS files.
* **DOS:** add a game folder zipped as `.zip` (it is nested so DOSBox Pure receives the archive as-is), or a single `.exe`/`.com`/`.bat`/`.conf`. **Doom:** add your own IWAD (`.wad`).

## 🔑 BIOS files

Open **Settings → 🔑 BIOS files…** (or ⋯ → *BIOS files…* on a game that needs one). Pick a system in the **dropdown** (all 18 BIOS systems, grouped, each with a status). The panel lists every file the core looks for with its level (**required** / **recommended** / **optional**), whether it is **installed** or **missing**, and the md5 libretro publishes for the usual dump (a stored file whose md5 differs is flagged, it may still work). Then:

* **Free, open-source files** get a **Download open files** button (and *Download all open files* for every system): files are fetched from the app's own `bios-open/` folder (same origin, so no CORS problems, cached for offline use), shown with a progress bar, **size + md5 verified** before they are stored, and never stored if the check fails.
* **Copyrighted files** (everything else) show a *“Must come from your own console”* note with the exact file name and md5 expected, the **Upload** button (`.zip` packs are unpacked, names that differ only by case such as `SCPH5501.BIN` are corrected) and a link to that system's [libretro documentation](https://docs.libretro.com/library/bios/) page.

Files are stored in IndexedDB on your device and, at launch, handed to EmulatorJS (`EJS_biosUrl`), which places them where the core looks for them. Files that must stay zipped (`neogeo.zip`, CD-i `cdimono1.zip`) are passed through untouched. Systems that *require* a BIOS show a ⚠ note in the game's menu until you add one.

| System | Offered by the dropdown | Source / licence |
|---|---|---|
| Game Boy Advance | **Download** `gba_bios.bin` (16 KB, optional) | [Cult of GBA open-source BIOS](https://github.com/Cult-of-GBA/BIOS) – **MIT**. mGBA also has its own built-in replacement, so no file is needed. |
| Game Boy | **Download** `gb_bios.bin` (256 B, optional boot ROM) | [SameBoy](https://github.com/LIJI32/SameBoy) v1.0.4 `dmg_boot.bin` – **Expat (MIT)**. Used by Gambatte; mGBA ignores non-original boot ROMs. |
| Game Boy Color | **Download** `gbc_bios.bin` (2.3 KB, optional boot ROM) | SameBoy `cgb_boot.bin` – **Expat (MIT)**. |
| Nintendo DS | nothing to download | melonDS FreeBIOS / DeSmuME 2015 run without files (built-in open replacements). Real `bios7.bin`, `bios9.bin`, `firmware.bin` are optional and come from your console. |
| Atari 5200 | nothing to download | The core contains the open-source AltirraOS; `5200.rom` is optional. |
| Commodore Amiga | nothing to download | PUAE contains the open-source AROS Kickstart; Retro Pocket selects it automatically while no real Kickstart is stored (`puae_kickstart=aros`). Real `kick*.A500/A600/A1200` files are recommended for many games. |
| PlayStation, Saturn | upload only | HLE BIOS is built in (limited); real BIOS from your console is recommended (`scph5501.bin` …, `saturn_bios.bin`). |
| **Must be dumped from your own console** | upload only, exact name + md5 shown | Sega CD (`bios_CD_U/E/J.bin`), PC Engine CD (`syscard3.pce`), PC-FX (`pcfx.rom`), 3DO (`panafz10.bin`), ColecoVision (`colecovision.rom`), CD-i (`cdimono1.zip`), Neo Geo / Arcade (`neogeo.zip`), Atari 7800 / Lynx (`7800 BIOS (U).rom`, `lynxboot.img`), NES Famicom Disk System (`disksys.rom`) |

Why only these three? libretro's own “Download Core System Files” pack contains only open per-core assets (no commercial BIOS) and its host sends no CORS headers, so a web page cannot fetch it. Other open BIOS replacements either live inside the cores already (AROS, AltirraOS, melonDS FreeBIOS) or are not accepted by the cores. Sources and licence texts are in [`www/bios-open/`](www/bios-open/README.md); md5/size/licence are verified by `npm run check`. BIOS delivery and the dialog are covered by `tests/bios.mjs` (mocked fetch: corrupt / truncated / 404 / slow / good, IndexedDB result, mGBA sees the downloaded `/gba_bios.bin` byte-for-byte) and `tests/library.mjs` (`neogeo.zip` arrives byte-identical).

## ⚠ Performance warnings

Heavy systems get a **⚠ badge** on the cover, a note in the game's menu and a banner on launch: **N64, PlayStation, PSP, Saturn, 3DO, DOS, CD-i** (and DS has its own note). Expect them to need a recent desktop or high-end phone; iPhone Safari (WebAssembly without JIT) will be slow for most of them. Heavy systems do not take periodic auto-resume snapshots (their states are huge); the snapshot is taken when you leave or background the game. The N64 default is Mupen64Plus-Next (ParaLLEl N64 on iOS, as EmulatorJS itself does); a core that aborts early triggers the automatic fallback to the alternate core.

## 🧵 Threads / cross-origin isolation (PSP, DOS)

PPSSPP and DOSBox Pure need threads, i.e. `SharedArrayBuffer`, which browsers only enable on *cross-origin isolated* pages (COOP + COEP response headers). GitHub Pages cannot send custom headers, so the service worker (`www/sw.js`, same idea as `coi-serviceworker`) adds `Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy: same-origin` and `Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy: require-corp` to **`player.html?…&iso=1`**, and `player.js` redirects there once (after making sure the worker is active) **only when the game's core needs threads**. Everything else stays non-isolated, because COEP would block the cross-origin script tags EmulatorJS injects: on the isolated page, `cdn.emulatorjs.org` responses are re-fetched with CORS (the CDN sends `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *`) and returned with `Cross-Origin-Resource-Policy: cross-origin`. The library page, cover-art fetches (GitHub raw/API, Wikipedia, Commons, Internet Archive, weserv) and all other cores are untouched.

Verified in headless Chrome against a plain `python -m http.server` (no isolation headers): `crossOriginIsolated === true`, `typeof SharedArrayBuffer === 'function'`, `EJS_threads === true`, frames advance for PPSSPP and DOSBox Pure, no request blocked by COEP, GB core stays non-isolated, and the library page still reaches `api.github.com`. **Not verified on devices:** iOS Safari (16.4+ supports SharedArrayBuffer under COOP/COEP and service workers; PPSSPP additionally needs WebGL2 and plenty of RAM, so expect it to be unusable on many iPhones) and the Capacitor Android WebView (Chromium; service workers work on `https://localhost`, but isolation could not be tested here). If isolation is unavailable the player shows a clear message instead of a blank screen.

## 🚫 Not supported (no core in EmulatorJS 4.2.3)

Magnavox Odyssey², Vectrex, Pokémon Mini, Mattel Intellivision, Neo Geo CD, Fairchild Channel F, Atari ST, MSX and Game & Watch have **no core in the pinned EmulatorJS release**, so they are not offered (nothing is faked). They will appear automatically only if a future pinned version ships cores for them and `www/js/cores.js` is extended. Neo Geo (AES/MVS) works through FBNeo; Sega SG-1000, Neo Geo Pocket Color, WonderSwan Color and Famicom Disk System are included.

## 🧪 Boot tests

`tests/systems.mjs` generates a tiny original stub image per system (`scripts/make-system-stubs.py`; not games), stores it in the library, launches the player with each system's default core **and every alternate core**, taps *Start*, and checks that the core downloaded, initialised and kept producing frames (and that threaded cores run isolated). That proves the core + file hand-off path for each family, **not that real games run** — stubs are not valid commercial images, so a core running garbage still counts as booted. The latest per-core results are committed in [`docs/boot-matrix.md`](docs/boot-matrix.md). Known results with stubs: every core boots except **Philips CD-i** (needs `cdimono1.zip`, reports "Required files are missing") and **Mupen64Plus-Next** aborts on the stub image ("table index is out of bounds") — in the app that is the automatic fallback case (ParaLLEl N64 boots).

## 🕹 Controllers (Bluetooth / USB gamepads)

Uses the browser **Gamepad API**, so Xbox, PlayStation (DualShock 4 / DualSense), Switch Pro, 8BitDo, MFi and generic pads work wherever the browser sees them: **iPhone/iPad Safari 13+ (Bluetooth pairing in Settings → Bluetooth)**, Android Chrome / the Android app (Chromium WebView), and desktop. Press any button after connecting — browsers only reveal a controller after its first input.

* **Auto-detect:** a toast appears on connect/disconnect (library and in game); the first pads become Player 1, 2, 3, 4 in connection order. The on-screen touch pad is **hidden while a controller is connected**, comes back when you touch the screen (and hides again on the next controller input), and returns on disconnect.
* **Settings → 🎮 Controllers…** (not an About tab): connected pads with a live input readout, per-pad **player assignment** (Auto / Player 1–4 / Off), **button layout** (*Nintendo positions*: right = A, bottom = B — or *Xbox labels*), **stick deadzone**, left-stick-as-D-pad, hide-touch-pad, hotkeys on/off, **keyboard** controls for desktop with a preset, and a **per-player remap table** (tap a control, then press the pad button / key you want; "Reset" per player). Mappings are stored in `localStorage` (`rp.pad`) and applied to EmulatorJS (`EJS_defaultControls` + re-applied after start) for **every system**, all four players. Player counts follow each system (table above, `players` in `www/js/cores.js`: e.g. 4 for N64 and arcade, 2 for NES/SNES/Genesis/PS1, 1 for handhelds); extra controllers are ignored by one-player systems.
* **Analog sticks / triggers:** a deadzone (radial) is applied to the sticks before EmulatorJS sees them. NES/GB/GBA/SNES/DS are digital, so the left stick acts as a D-pad (and "hat" D-pads that browsers expose as an axis are decoded); analog triggers act as L2/R2 buttons. On the analog systems (**N64, PlayStation, PSP**; `analog: true` in `cores.js`) both sticks are passed through unmodified apart from the deadzone: the left stick is the analog stick (N64/PSP/PS1 analog mode), the right stick is the N64 C-buttons, **L2/R2** are the PS1/PSP triggers and **Z** on N64, L3/R3 are the stick clicks. Arcade/Neo Geo: **Select = Coin**, **Start = Start** (hold Select+Start still opens the app menu). Per-system hints are shown in the pause menu.
* **In game hotkeys:** hold **Select + Start** (or press the **Guide/Home** button) for the pause menu (Resume, Save state, Load state, Restart, Sound, Fast-forward, Screenshot, Exit… — the same menu as the top ☰ button); **Select + R1** quick-save, **Select + L1** quick-load. While Select is held, Start/L1/R1 are not sent to the game. Turn this off in the Controllers screen if a game needs those combos.
* **Library with a controller:** D-pad / left stick moves between games and menu items, **A** opens (Nintendo layout: right button; Xbox layout: bottom button), **B** goes back/closes, **Start** opens the game's options, **Select** opens Settings, **L1/R1** switch the system filter.
* **Desktop keyboard defaults (Retro Pocket preset):** arrows = D-pad, **X** = A, **Z** = B, **S** = X, **A** = Y, **Q/W** = L/R, **Enter** = Start, **Backspace** = Select, **F5/F9** quick save/load. Remappable.
* **Tested with a mocked Gamepad API** (`node tests/pads.mjs`, headless Chrome with `navigator.getGamepads` overridden): connect/disconnect, library navigation, remap capture, deadzone, trigger handling, 2-player routing, touch-pad hiding, hotkeys and the pause menu. **Not tested on real hardware:** actual Bluetooth/USB pads, iOS Safari, and the Capacitor Android WebView (it is Chromium, so the same API is available, but the app window must have focus; some pads/OS versions report a non-standard button order — remap in the Controllers screen if so).

## 🛡 Crash protection

The player pins EmulatorJS to a fixed version (`4.2.3`, see `EJS_VERSION` in `www/js/cores.js`), flushes battery saves only while a game is running in the foreground (guarded, never throws), and only loads an auto-resume snapshot taken by the **same core**. If a core aborts or freezes, the **Game crashed** screen offers *Resume from last auto-save*, *Restart*, *Try another core* and *Back to library*; a crash in the first 15 s switches cores automatically once. NES now defaults to **Nestopia**; FCEUmm is a per-game option.

# Android APK (needs JDK 21 and the Android SDK; ANDROID_HOME set)
npm run android:debug     # -> android/app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk
npm run android:open      # or open in Android Studio
```

After editing anything in `www/`, run `npx cap sync android` before rebuilding the APK. Icons are generated by `npm run icons` (Pillow) and `python3 scripts/make-android-assets.py`.

### Deploying
* **GitHub Pages:** repo **Settings → Pages → Source: GitHub Actions** (the `pages.yml` workflow deploys `www/` on every push to `main`).
* **APK:** `android.yml` builds a debug-signed APK on every push, uploads it as an artifact and refreshes the `latest` release; tagging `v1.0.0` creates a versioned release.

### Self-hosting EmulatorJS (optional)
By default the loader and cores come from `https://cdn.emulatorjs.org/stable/data/`. To bundle them (fully offline from first launch), download an EmulatorJS release into `www/ejs/data/` (or the cores you need) and set `window.RP_EJS_DATA = 'ejs/data/'` before `js/player.js` loads in `www/player.html`; add the files to `SHELL_FILES` in `www/sw.js` if you want them precached.

## Troubleshooting
* *"Could not load the emulator"* — you're offline and haven't played that system yet; connect once to cache the core.
* *No sound on iPhone* — tap the on-screen Start button / screen once; also check the ringer switch.
* *"App not installed" when updating the APK* — see *Installing and updating the APK*: uninstall the old app once (it was signed with a different key), then install the new APK; later updates install over it.
* *Game crashed* — use the on-screen *Resume* / *Try another core*. *A game won't start* — try the other core via the **⋯** menu → *Emulator core*. Zipped ROMs are supported by most cores; if the system isn't recognised you'll be asked to pick one.
